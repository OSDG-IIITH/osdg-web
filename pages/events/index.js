Then in a 40 day period, implement the technologies related to it. Team up with as many friends as you want, there are no restrictions at all!

With the help of our amazing mentors to guide you with the technical aspects, you‚Äôll gain new skills and be able to get your hands dirty with them over the course of under two months."
