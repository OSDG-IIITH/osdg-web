<h1>Fedora KDE dual-boot guide</h1>

</div>
<p>This guide shows you how to dual-boot Fedora KDE (or any other Fedora
edition of your choice) with Windows 10/11. There are some extra
resources linked at the end that can help you if you get stuck.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the latest version of Fedora is 42. We
recommend that you download the latest version of Fedora that is
available, instead of using the version this guide uses.</p>
<p>Please follow this guide from top to bottom step-by-step if you’re a
beginner to Linux. Do <strong>not</strong> attempt to use an LLM to
summarize this document. LLMs make mistakes.</p>
<p>If you want a video to follow, I recommend KSK Royal’s excellent
Fedora Dual-boot guide available at the below link. Please come back and
follow the <a href="#ais">After-install Steps</a> once you’re done
following this video guide.</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<h2>Things you need</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An internet connection</p></li>
<li><p>A 4 GiB (gigabyte) or larger pendrive to flash Fedora on to.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>8GiB+ is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>This pendrive will be <strong>WIPED</strong>, so please back up
any existing data on it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A back-up of your computer’s data in case anything goes wrong
(which you should be taking anyway)</p></li>
<li><p>At least 100GiB of free space on your hard drive to install
Fedora on to.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Downloading the installer ISO</h2>
<p>To install Fedora KDE, you must download the “live” “ISO” file. An
ISO file is a file that contains a bunch of files (i.e. an archive of
files) which can be flashed onto a pendrive or CD.</p>
<p>A live system is an operating system that can directly be booted off
of a pendrive or CD without installing it to the hard disk. This system
is ephemeral in nature, meaning that it loses any file/disk changes you
make when you reboot. It is a great way to test out an operating system
and see if it is compatible with your machine’s hardware without
installing it on your machine’s hard drive. Most Linux distros
(including Fedora) provide a Live system ISO that you can use to boot
into a flashed pen-drive and run the installer from within the live
system.</p>
<p>This ISO can be downloaded from the <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora Website</a>. I recommend you try
finding the download link to the latest version of “Fedora KDE Plasma
Desktop” (the latest version is 42, as of time of writing) yourself, but
if you are unable to, here’s a link to that page:</p>

<h3>What is the difference between Fedora, Fedora KDE, and Plasma
Desktop?</h3>
<p><strong>Fedora</strong> is the distribution of Linux that we’re going
to be using. A Linux distribution is (in layman’s terms) a collection of
packages that come with your operating system to make using it easier.
This can include low-level things like the bootloader (Fedora uses GRUB)
, kernel (Fedora 42 uses Linux 6.15), to high level things like the
Desktop Environment (the GUI you see, depends on the Fedora Edition ),
the Web Browser (Fedora uses Firefox), and much more.</p>
<p>All of these components can be swapped for other things, which makes
a Linux install one of the most customizable and powerful systems out
there! Linux runs on computers, phones (Android), toasters, Raspberry
Pis, and even on the Mars Rover!</p>
<p><strong>KDE</strong> e.V. is a German non-profit organisation that
develops free and open-source software for everyone to use. One of them
is the <strong>Plasma Desktop Environment</strong> (which many people
call “KDE“), a highly customisable and user-friendly desktop-environment
for Linux and some other OSes. Plasma also comes with its own suite of
applications, like a file manager (Dolphin), a PDF Viewer (Okular), an
Image Viewer (Gwenview ), some games like Solitaire and Minesweeper, and
much more!</p>
<p>There are also other desktop environments that are available on
Linux, an example being GNOME, a simple and user-friendly DE. GNOME has
its own suite of applications (like Nautilus, Papers, Loupe for the
GNOME equivalents of applications mentioned above).</p>
<p>The choice of a DE depends on your use-case and preference. We
recommend KDE because it looks familiar to Windows users, is more
customisable, and has better support for newer technologies like HDR and
VRR. But it’s entirely up to you to choose which DE to use, since it’s
your computer and Linux lets you choose.</p>

<h3 id="dli">Downloading the ISO</h3>
<p>Click on the download button next to the ISO you want. If you have an
Intel/AMD CPU (most of you will), download the x86_64 ISO. If you have
an ARM CPU (Snapdragon X-Elite), download the aarch64 ISO. Click the
little green download icon to begin downloading. <strong>Make sure you
download the Live ISO</strong>, and not anything else.</p>

<h4>Download using a Torrent Client (for advanced users)</h4>
<p><em>Note: This section is only for advanced users who have torrented
before. You may safely skip this section if you wish.</em></p>
<p>Downloading a large file ( 2.5 GiB) through a browser may have issues
if you’re on a slow/unreliable connection. You can use a torrent client
like <a href="https://qbittorrent.org">https://qbittorrent.org</a> to
download Fedora (and most other Linux ISOs), which is faster, more
reliable, and contributes back to the open-source community if you seed
(you should (I’m watching you)).</p>
<p>You can get the torrent file for Fedora ISOs from <a
href="https://torrent.fedoraproject.org.">https://torrent.fedoraproject.org.</a></p>
<p>Again, we recommend finding the download links yourself, but here are
some direct download links in case you weren’t able to.</p>

<h4>Download using Fedora Media Writer</h4>
<p>You can also download the ISO using Fedora Media Writer, an
application made by the Fedora team to flash ISOs to a pendrive. Skip to
the <a href="#fmw">Fedora Media Writer</a> section to see
instructions.</p>
<h3>Checking the ISO’s hash</h3>
<p>Please refer to the instructions given <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media/#sect-verifying-images">here</a>
to verify the integrity of the downloaded ISO file.</p>
<h2>Flashing the Pendrive</h2>
<p>Let’s flash the pendrive with the ISO so we can boot into it. There
are tools made specifically for this purpose, we’ll dive into two of
those here, Rufus (for Windows computers), and Fedora Media Writer (for
all computers, intended as a backup option if Rufus doesn’t work for
some reason).</p>
<p>Make sure you’ve inserted your pendrive into the computer. <strong>A
final warning: This step removes all the data on your pendrive. Make
sure you have backed it up (i.e. copied it to another
location)</strong>.</p>
<p>To avoid flashing the wrong drive, please disconnect any other
external storage devices you may have connected (such as other
pendrives, SSDs, CDs, etc).</p>
<p>During the flashing process, Windows may show some notifications
about “something being wrong with the drive” or to “choose options” for
it. Please ignore these notifications.</p>
<h3>Using Rufus</h3>
<p>Rufus is a tool that helps you flash an ISO file onto a pendrive.</p>
<p>It is a tool specifically built <strong>for Windows
computers</strong>. If you’re using something else, you should use
Fedora Media Writer (described in the next section).</p>
<p>Download Rufus from <a href="https://rufus.ie.">https://rufus.ie.</a>
For Intel and AMD computers, download the x64 version. For ARM
computers, download the ARM64 version. You can download the “Portable”
version if you like (i.e. it does not have an installer, but the direct
executable file is downloaded instead). The Portable version is easier
to remove from your computer (you don’t have to go to Settings and
manually remove it, just delete the downloaded file).</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Rufus_Download_Page.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the Rufus download page</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, open Rufus (you may click “No” on the update confirmation
dialog that appears), it should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Rufus_Start.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the start menu of Rufus</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select your pendrive from the dropdown list.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the SELECT button (make sure the dropdown next to it says
Disk or ISO image).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the ISO you downloaded in the file picker that
appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not make any changes to any other settings.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Rufus should look similar to the below image:</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Rufus_Flashing.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of an example of the options to be
selected</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, click the “START” button to flash the pendrive. Use the ISO
Image mode as recommended. If this pendrive doesn’t boot during the boot
process described later, re-flash using DD mode.</p>
<p>If a warning about the GRUB version comes up, select the option to
download the latest GRUB from the internet (usually “Yes”).</p>
<p>Say “OK” to the warning about disk data erasure popup to begin
flashing your pendrive!</p>
<p>After it’s done, Rufus should give you a notification/sound and say
its status is READY again. You may close Rufus when this is done.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Rufus_Starts.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the last step</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Using Ventoy</h3>
<p>Ventoy is a tool that helps you flash and boot ISO files from a
pendrive.</p>
<p>It is a tool that works on multiple platforms, including Linux,
Windows and MacOS.</p>
<p>Download Ventoy from <a
href="https://www.ventoy.net.">https://www.ventoy.net.</a> On the
Download page, select the appropriate version for your system. For
windows, download the <code>.zip</code> file, extract it, and run
<code>Ventoy2Disk.exe</code>.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Ventoy_Page.png" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the Ventoy download page</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you open Ventoy, it should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Ventoy_Install_1.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of Ventoy once downloaded</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select your pendrive from the dropdown list</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <code>Install</code> button to install Ventoy to the
selected USB drive.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the warning prompts that appear (ensure you have backed
up the data in the disk before)</p></li>
<li><p>Once the installation is complete, the USB drive will can be used
for ISO files</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Ventoy_Install_2.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of Ventoy while flashing the
ISO</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, copy the ISO file downloaded to the Ventoy-formatted USB drive.
You can use the drive for booting once done. During boot, Ventoy will
show the list of available ISO files to select from.</p>
<h3 id="fmw">Using Fedora Media Writer</h3>
<p>Fedora Media Writer is a pendrive flashing tool developed by the same
team as the Fedora Linux distribution. We keep this option as a backup
because Rufus generally has more success with bespoke computer
configurations. Fedora Media Writer only supports x86_64 devices.</p>
<p>Please refer to the instructions given <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media">here</a>
to download and use Fedora Media Writer.</p>
<p>Note that while writing the ISO image to the USB device, you may
choose the “Download automatically” option and select the “Fedora KDE
Plasma Desktop” option from the dropdown instead of “Fedora
Workstation”. Once you click “Next”, make sure to select version 42, and
choose the correct hardware architecture. See <a href="#dli">this</a>
section to determine your hardware architecture.</p>
<h2>Creating space for Fedora</h2>
<p>Now, we need to partition the computer’s hard drive into two to give
some space for Fedora. For most college-work and daily tasks, giving
80-128GiB of space to fedora should be enough.</p>
<p>If you plan on using Fedora/Linux more faithfully and want to install
lots of software and games on it, try giving as much space to fedora as
you can, leaving windows with about 40GiB of <em>free space</em>
left.</p>
<p>Files on your Windows computer can be viewed under Fedora, so you
don’t have to worry about moving important stuff onto another drive to
copy it over to Fedora.</p>
<p>Your computer’s drives may already be partitioned into some units
(called partitions/volumes) by Windows, and you may have multiple drives
in your computer. This section comes down to your preference of which
partition of your drive to shrink to make space for the new Fedora
volume that will be created. Fedora will be installed onto this
partition of your drive.</p>
<p>To partition your drive, open Windows Disk management by following
<strong>one</strong> of these two methods listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Right-click the start button and choose Disk Management</p></li>
<li><p>Type “Disk Management” and choose “Create and format hard disk
partitions” in the start menu</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The window that opened should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Disk_Management_1.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the disk management
window</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It might look different for you — you may have more/less drives with
more/less partitions.</p>
<p>Find the drive with the “Windows C:” partition. If you have a D:
drive or an E: drive, you may have multiple partitions listed, in which
case, find the largest partition which is NOT an EFI or recovery
partition to shrink to give space to Fedora. You can use your file
explorer’s This PC page to see which drives map to which partitions if
it isn’t clearly obvious from just this program’s screen.</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the partition to shrink (I choose the Windows C:
partition), right-click it and click the “Shrink Volume option”.</p>
<p>This dialog should appear.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Shrink_Volume.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the Shrink Volume Window</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the input, enter the amount of space to give to Fedora <strong>in
MiB</strong> (Windows displays MiB as MB, the difference between MiB and
MB is left as an exercise to the reader). 1 GiB is 1024 MiB, so use your
computer’s calculator to find the equivalent amount in MiB.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to give Fedora 128 gigabytes of space, I’d
type <code>131072</code> (128*1024) in the input box.</p>
<p>Do choose wisely, as changing this number in the future will require
you to <strong>remove and re-install Fedora</strong>.</p>
<p>Click “Shrink” to shrink the partition.</p>
<p>You should now have a fresh unallocated volume show up.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Disk_Parted.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the disk information after
partition</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You may close Disk Management.</p>
<h2>Disabling BitLocker Encryption (only for Win10 Pro / Win 11)</h2>
<p><em>Note: This step is only necessary for Windows 10 Pro and Windows
11 (all editions) devices. You can skip this section if you have Win 10
Home or an older edition of Windows.</em></p>
<p>BitLocker is Windows” solution for full-disk encryption, i.e. it
encrypts the contents of your hard drive. It is a nice feature, but
unfortunately, it prevents dual-booting with Linux in an easy way.</p>
<p>There is a way of keeping BitLocker enabled while having Linux
dualbooted, but that process is very advanced. Also, keeping BitLocker
enabled will prevent you from accessing your Windows files from
Linux.</p>
<p>For now, we will have to disable this feature to proceed with the
installation.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that if you forget to disable BitLocker
encryption, it may render your Windows installation in a partially or
fully bricked state.</strong></p>
<p>To disable BitLocker encryption:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Search for “disable encryption” in the start menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the first option that appears (should be the Settings app
or the Control Panel).</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/BitLocker_Page.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of the BitLocker settings
page</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Select the disk you want to disable BitLocker on (usually the C:
drive).</p></li>
<li><p>Backup the BitLocker key if you wish to keep it
(optional).</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Bitlocker_Save.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of saving the BitLocker encryption
key</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Click the “Turn off BitLocker” option.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Bitlocker_Disable.jpeg" style="height:6cm" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A screenshot of disabling BitLocker</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This process will take a bit of time (depending on the size of your
drive) to complete.</p>
<h2>Boot into your computer’s UEFI Settings</h2>
<p><strong>Before proceeding into the UEFI, please make sure you have
your pendrive plugged in.</strong> This is to allow the UEFI to show you
the pendrive’s entry in the boot order selection page (covered
later).</p>
<p>Now you have to boot into your computer’s UEFI (Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface) settings. A computer’s UEFI is (in layman’s terms )
the part of the computer that is responsible for starting the operating
system and is generally the first thing that starts up when you boot
your computer.</p>
<p>Your computer’s UEFI has some settings that you have to change to
allow you to boot into your Fedora pendrive.</p>
<p><em>Note: The UEFI Settings may also be (incorrectly) referred to as
the BIOS settings by some manufacturers and websites. Other names for it
are Boot Options, Firmware Settings, etc.</em></p>
<p>You can boot into the UEFI settings from Windows by following any
<strong>one</strong> of these two steps:</p>
<h3>Method 1: Advanced Startup</h3>
<p>Windows has a feature called Advanced Startup that allows you to,
among other things, boot into the UEFI Settings.</p>
<p>To get into advanced startup mode, follow any <strong>one</strong> of
these two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open Command Prompt, and type the below command in it and press
enter.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode cmd"><code class="sourceCode dosbat"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>shutdown <span class="at">/r</span> <span class="at">/o</span> <span class="at">/f</span> <span class="at">/t</span> 00</span></code></pre></div>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open the start menu as if you were going to restart your
computer, but <em>hold down Shift on your keyboard</em> while you press
the Restart button.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Boot into the UEFI Settings:</strong></p>
<p>When you’re in advanced startup, press Troubleshoot, then Advanced
Options, then click UEFI Firmware Settings, and finally click Restart to
boot into the UEFI settings.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/AS-1.jpg" style="height:6cm" /></p></td>
<td><p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/AS-2.jpg" style="height:6cm" /></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/AS-3.jpg" style="height:6cm" /></p></td>
<td><p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/AS-4.jpg" style="height:6cm" /></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="keyb">Method 2: Keyboard smashing</h3>
<p>You can open the UEFI settings by repeatedly pressing a specific key
on your keyboard as soon as the machine starts up. The specific key
depends from manufacturer to manufacturer and laptop to laptop.</p>
<p>It’s usually one of F2, F7, F12, Delete, Enter, etc. Here’s a list of
the keys for some common manufacturers:</p>
<pre><code>Acer: F2 or DEL
  ASUS: F2 or DEL
  Dell: F2 or F12
  HP: ESC or F10
  Lenovo: F2 or Fn + F2
  MSI: DEL
</code></pre>
<p>If these do not work, you’ll need to find the key for your device, by
searching the internet. Search for “How to open BIOS on &lt;laptop
brand&gt;”, replacing &lt;laptop brand&gt; with your laptop’s name and
model (for example Framework 13, Lenovo Thinkpad, etc.).</p>
<p>Once you find the key, restart your computer, and press that key up
and down rapidly. You should directly be dropped into the BIOS.</p>
<h2>Change Boot Order and Disable UEFI</h2>
<p>UEFI firmware settings look different from computer to computer.
Older laptops will have a screen that is only controllable using keys on
your keyboard, while newer ones have mouse support. I will not be
providing screenshots here since UEFIs are different from computer to
computer.</p>
<p>Please feel free to use an internet search engine to get help with
this step. Stick to your manufacturer’s official website if they have
instructions there. Popular YouTube videos may also be consulted.</p>
<p>Get familiar with your UEFI’s control scheme. If it’s keyboard only,
it’s usually listed at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Next, you have to find the “Boot Order” listing. It’s usually present
in the “Boot” category. It looks like a changeable list of “bootable”
secondary storage media like Hard Drives, CDs, pendrives, etc. You must
move your pendrive to the top of the list, if it isn’t there already.
Please look at the control scheme to know how to do so. Usually to move
entries, it’s the F5/F6 or +/- keys on your keyboard, but please check
instead of blindly trusting this guide. If you find multiple USB
entries, move them all to the top.</p>
<p>After that’s done, you can “Save and Exit” from the BIOS (usually the
F10 key, but please check). The computer should now boot into Fedora
from the pendrive.</p>
<p>You’ll see a GNU GRUB boot menu, don’t worry about that, either wait
for it to automatically select, or choose “Test this media and start
Fedora 42” from the list. Booting may take a few minutes.</p>
<p>Note that if you do not see the GRUB boot menu, or the computer
reboots into Windows, you will need to disable Secure Boot. Re-boot into
the BIOS/UEFI menu, and find an option called “Secure Boot” and
<strong>disable</strong> it. It’s usually present in the “Security”
category of your UEFI.</p>
<h3>Using the boot menu</h3>
<p>If the boot order page in the UEFI didn’t work, most laptops allow
you to choose a boot device. You can find the Boot Menu key using the
same instructions as finding the BIOS key as outlined <a
href="#keyb">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also choose the boot device from the Advanced Startup part of
Windows too.</p>
<h2>Explore the Live System</h2>
<p><em>Note: The following screenshots are of Fedora KDE.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the Fedora KDE Live System! This is what you should be
seeing.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Fedora-1.png" style="height:10cm" /></p>
<p>Please note that the version of KDE Plasma which is installed on the
pendrive is <em>older</em> than the version that’ll be installed once
you install Fedora. Expect some visual differences.</p>
<p>You can now look around the environment, see what apps are present,
see how KDE works, and explore as much as you wish! Do remember that
whatever files you create, apps you install, or settings you modify will
be <strong>lost</strong> on the next reboot.</p>
<p>Also do remember that any changes you make to <strong>other
drives</strong> on your computer (such as the one with Windows) in the
live system <strong>WILL</strong> persist, so don’t go deleting System32
thinking it’ll magically revert back!</p>
<p>The Welcome application that opens up when you start the distro is
quite helpful. Please take a look at what it says. If you missed it, it
can be opened by opening the “Welcome Center” application from the
“Start Menu“-like equivalent (called Application Launcher on KDE).</p>
<p>Once you’re done exploring, open the Fedora Installer application
(called Install to Hard Drive) by clicking the shortcut on the Desktop,
or from the Start Menu.</p>
<p>This will open a full-screen Anaconda installer.</p>
<h2>Install Fedora</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Fedora Installer!</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-1.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>Choose your desired language, and click next. You should be seeing
this screen (henceforth dubbed the “Main menu”).</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-2.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>We shall now go step-by-step through the installer</p>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>Click “Keyboard” in the main menu. English (US) is the keyboard
layout that most QWERTY keyboards in India use.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-3.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>If you’ve purchased your computer from outside the country, e.g.
Dubai or Germany, you may have a different keyboard layout. Add one by
pressing the “+” button. Select your keyboard’s layout and click “Add”.
You can remove the existing “English (US)” layout by selecting it and
clicking the “-” button. You may also add additional keyboard layouts
for different languages if you wish.</p>
<p>Test out your keyboard layout and make sure it’s correct (by checking
all the keys on your keyboard and seeing if they map correctly) using
the input box in the top right.</p>
<p>After you’re done, click the “Done” button that’s present on the
<strong>top-left</strong> of the screen.</p>
<h3>Time &amp; Date</h3>
<p>Choose “Time &amp; Date” from the main menu, and select Region “Asia”
and city “Kolkata”. Leave date-time as automatic, don’t change anything
else.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-4.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<h3>Network &amp; Host Name</h3>
<p>Let’s give your computer a name. Select “Network &amp; Host Name”
from the main menu, and type a name for your computer. This is your
computer’s name, NOT your username. It will be visible when anyone tries
to connect to your computer.</p>
<p>Click apply and then click done to change the host name.</p>
<p>You may choose to connect to the Internet using the WiFi icon in the
“Taskbar” (called Panel in KDE), but that’s optional. If you do decide
to connect, KDE might ask you to create a new “Wallet” (a place where
passwords are stored). You can choose a simple blowfish wallet with a
simple password since it’s a live environment. The wallet will
automatically be set up for you in the actual install.</p>
<h3>User Creation</h3>
<p>Choose “User Creation” from the main menu. Here you’ll create a user
for this machine. Enter your details and make sure the “wheel group
membership” option is checked.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-5.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>Please enter a password, do not uncheck the “Require a password”
option. It only creates headaches for you later.</p>
<p>Click “Done” to go back.</p>
<p>In the main menu, the root account should automatically be disabled.
There’s nothing for us to do there.</p>
<h3>Installation Destination</h3>
<p>Here’s the main (and most important) part! We shall now select the
drive to install Fedora to! Please be careful here. You must choose the
drive that you gave space to in the Disk Management step.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-6.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>Notice how I have only one disk and how there is a checkmark on that
disk? Fedora has automatically selected that disk and decided on an
automatic partition layout.</p>
<p>If you want to select another disk, click it until the checkmark
appears on it. Click a checkmarked disk to unselect it (the check
disappears). A disk being blue does not mean it’s selected, that’s just
visual feedback because you clicked it. Selected disks are
checkmarked.</p>
<p>For dualbooting, we have to create partitions ourselves.
<strong>Select “Custom” in the storage configuration</strong> and click
done.</p>
<p>You should see this page:</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-7.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>Notice how Fedora has automatically detected 128GiB of free space
that I had created using Disk Management on Windows earlier.</p>
<p>The Fedora installer offers to automatically create partitions for
us. You may choose to Encrypt your Data using a password (which achieves
the same effect as BitLocker, but requiring a password to decrypt the
drive, instead of being seamless) if you wish.</p>
<p>Click the “Click here to create them automatically” button. This
creates a partition layout using btrfs, a filesystem that lets you do
cool things like take snapshots of your data (which is outside the scope
of this guide).</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-8.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>Notice that the available space jumped down to 1.3MiB. The partitions
have been made to be created, let’s press “Done” and accept our changes
to go back! Please note that there should not be any “Delete” entries in
the changes list.</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-9.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<h3>Install!</h3>
<p><strong>This is the last time you can turn back and make a backup of
your system if you haven’t already.</strong> Clicking the “Begin
Installation” button will perform changes to your hard drive. If you’ve
followed all the steps as above, you can continue without fear.</p>
<p>Click Begin Installation to partition your disks and start the
installation!</p>
<p><img src="/linux-installation/assets/Installer-10.png" style="height:8cm" /></p>
<p>After the installation is done, click “Finish Installation” to close
the installer. You have installed Fedora on your hard drive! You can now
restart your computer to exit the live environment, or continue looking
around if you like.</p>
<p>To restart your computer, open the application launcher and press the
“Restart” button and confirm to restart your computer.</p>
<div>
<p>That’s right! KDE asks for confirmations for restarts and shut downs,
so you don’t have to worry about accidentally restarting your computer
instead of shutting it down!</p>
</div>
<p>You should now reboot into Fedora. The GRUB menu that appears should
let you pick between booting into Fedora or Windows. Congratulations!
You’ve successfully dual-booted your computer.</p>
<div>
<p>If you aren’t booted into Fedora, but into windows directly, you’ll
have to open your UEFI settings and update the boot order to move the
Fedora entry to the top.</p>
